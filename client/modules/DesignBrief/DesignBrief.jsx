    question: 'How might we improve safety on the street?',
    intro: 'What can be done to improve pedestrian and bicycle safety in San Diego? “There is a latent demand in the public to walk and bike more, but many people, out of a lack of safe routes, choose not to,” said Colin Parent, Circulate San Diego’s Executive Director and City Council member in La Mesa. As the city of San Diego grows in population, more residents are choosing to use walking and biking to avoid traffic congestion and parking. However, since walking and biking are not the norm they can be dangerous in a city built for cars.<br><br>In response, city leaders have adopted the <a href="https://www.sandiego.gov/mayor/initiatives/vision-zero" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vision Zero</a> program. Its goal is to eliminate all traffic deaths in the city by 2025, through enforcement, education and street engineering. But what does that mean in practice? How might we realistically redesign our city so that it is more safe for bicycles and pedestrians?',

Is it possible that these intersections, like Mission Blvd. and Garnet Ave., have something in common that is causing this lack of safety?<br><br><a href="http://www.circulatesd.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Circulate San Diego</a>, a local non-profit devoted to promoting safe neighborhoods, streets and intersections compiled the list and estimates the cost to address these dangers at approximately $200,000. Addressing these dangerous spots is important, as is understanding how a spot becomes dangerous over time. What are the early warning signs that an intersection might be deadly, before someone is actually killed in a traffic accident?<br><br>The Fatal 15 aren’t the only intersections in San Diego though, there are many intersections that are safe and provide a great experience for bikers riding through. What is the difference between these safe intersections and the dangerous ones? What kinds of intersections provide more safety for pedestrians and bikers (e.g. roundabouts and t-junctions)? It’s also imperative that we educate the public about these intersections, and pedestrian safety in general. Education is an effective tool that can be used to give pedestrians alternate routes or even alternate forms of transportation. However, providing education requires some amount of time (rather asking a person to read a pamphlet or listen to a public service announcement), and may not be applied at the appropriate time to encourage someone to alter their behaviors. How might we share information about Circulate San Diego’s research on the Fatal 15 with pedestrians, bikers and drivers as they cruise through these spaces?',

    question: 'How do we take our hands off the wheel?',
    intro: 'An autonomous vehicle (self-driving car) is a vehicle that can drive itself without human guidance. These vehicles are arriving faster than most people have anticipated. How might we prepare for this major advance in transportation? An important concern about adding Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is the effect of “driverless” on the industries that hire drivers, as well as the drivers themselves. There are also policy questions about Autonomous Vehicles such as, determining fault in the case of an accident (e.g., passenger, manufacturer, designer). However, a related concern is how other drivers will engage with AVs—there is some concern that other drivers might cut off, chase down, or otherwise aggressively engage with AVs.<br><br>Lastly, it may be easy to hack an AV, as they are designed to continuously receive information from other cars and sensors on the road through a “WiFi like” transmission system. Preparing for AVs may also mean rethinking the design of our existing roadways and signage. If AVs can monitor the speed and distance of other AVs, that means that cars can potentially travel at far faster speeds and in very close proximity. Will stop lights be necessary in this not-so-distant future?',

        text: 'The experience of riding in an autonomous vehicle (AV) may be very different than driving. Driving may no longer be about keeping your eyes on the road and hands at 10 and 2. Moving around, dancing, even singing karaoke are all possibilities when driverless cars are involved. Several automotive companies have made a pledge to have AVs on the road before 2020.<br><br>As one example of how AVs might offer a radically new experience, think about what work might be like while riding in an AV. Many cars are already WiFi-enabled and wired for conference calls. Without needing to focus on the road, a rider could focus on that pressing report that\'s due. In fact, why meet in an office conference room, if we could sit around a table while cruising down La Jolla’s Scenic Drive?',

        text: 'San Diego is already beginning to test out autonomous vehicles under the direction of <a href="http://www.sandag.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SANDAG</a>. As autonomous vehicles begin to rise in popularity and use, professions and labor markets that depend on cars will transform. For example, Uber, Lyft, and other ride-sharing companies may switch over completely and change their platforms to reflect the changes in the use of the roads. Thinking about the thousands of people who work in this gig market, what will they do next? In the past, such technology shifts have been accompanied by job retraining and transition periods that help the labor force adapt—though it is unclear what such professional development might look like as these gig economies evolve. As might other industries related to human driven vehicles, e.g., vehicle insurance, container shipping, and the traffic engineering profession. What kinds of changes need to be made to accommodate the job training or potential spike in unemployment if industries rapidly adopt AVs?',

        text: 'San Diego is one of the 10 cities that <a href="http://www.dmv.org/articles/self-driving-in-the-sunshine-san-diego-to-test-driverless-cars/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has been selected by the Department of Transportation</a> to test introducing autonomous vehicles (AVs) to city streets. Though it’s important to note that AVs not only ride on the streets, they might also talk with the street, the light signals and all other sensors even miles down the road. AVs use onboard sensors to detect potential immediate hazards, but also integrate with other cars and sensors in a communication network that connects them to potential dangers miles ahead.<br><br>For passengers, these safety precautions add to a relaxing experience of being chauffeured, but for walkers, bikers and others’ on the road, negotiating traffic with an AV may be a stressful experience. How might an AV signal to a walker or biker that they have been “seen” and accounted for in the navigation routing system, and that it’s actually safe to walk?<br><br>Another concern is that computing systems can be hacked. To communicate with other cars and sensors along the drive, AVs access part of the radio frequency spectrum set aside explicitly for cars, and called <a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/20151020/featured/what-is-dsrc-for-the-connected-car-tag6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Dedicated Short-Range Communication”</a>. AVs can use this frequency to communicate with other sensors within a 1,000 foot range. However, because AVs are open to receive signals it leaves them vulnerable to hacking. Hacking a car is somewhat different than breaking in and stealing the vehicle—hacked cars might be rerouted, used to reroute other vehicles, or hacking might simply be to delete the car’s log files. All frightening possibilities that need design solutions.',
