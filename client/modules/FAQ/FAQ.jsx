    question: 'What is unique about the D4SD Civic Design Challenge?',
    answer: 'The D4SD civic design challenge is unlike any other. As an initiative of the <a href="http://designlab.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UC San Diego Design Lab</a>, we have leveraged concepts from human-centered design and crowdsourcing to create a process where innovators can collectively solve local civic issues. Here’s how our four-stage process works:<ol><li><b>Discover:</b> Learn about the local civic issues through the D4SD.org website, through the Slack discussion forum, and through user research. Your goal here is to become an expert on a specific mobility challenge facing people in the San Diego region. Teach others about what you discover.</li><li><b>Ideate:</b> Pick a specific mobility problem and generate many creative solutions to address the issue. Join us for group brainstorming at the Sept 22nd Design Sprint and Hackathon, or jump on the Slack discussion forum.  The goal here is not to just run with your first idea. Come up with lots of ideas, merge them with others, and choose a concept that will be novel, feasible, and impactful.</li><li><b>Prototype:</b> Now that you and your team have an idea, it is time to build a mockup of your concept.  A prototype can be anything that makes your idea concrete and testable, such as a click-through demo, a 3D model, a service-design blueprint, an algorithm, a physical mockup, a video demo, etc. Your goal here is to create a prototype that will help you communicate your vision and test assumptions about your solution. Prototypes are due no later than Oct 24th through the D4SD website.</li><li><b>Implement:</b> Teams with the best prototypes will be selected as finalists and will have unique opportunities to pitch their concept to startup accelerators and the City of San Diego. We would love for your best solutions to make it in the real-world!</li></ol>Furthermore, the D4SD civic design challenge has partnered with <a href="http://www.scalesd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SCALE SD</a> and the <a href="http://designforwardsd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Forward Alliance</a> to host a series of in-person events to help you connect with other innovators. Our goal is to motivate citizens to think creatively and come up with solutions that improve mobility in San Diego.',
