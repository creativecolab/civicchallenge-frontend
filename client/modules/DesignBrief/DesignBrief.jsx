    question: 'How might we improve safety on the street?',
    intro: 'What can be done to improve pedestrian and bicycle safety in San Diego? “There is a latent demand in the public to walk and bike more, but many people, out of a lack of safe routes, choose not to,” said Kathleen Ferrier, Circulate San Diego’s Director of Advocacy. As the city of San Diego grows in population, more residents are choosing to use walking and biking to avoid traffic congestion and parking. However, since walking and biking are not the norm they can be dangerous in a city built for cars. In response, city leaders have adopted the “Vision Zero” program. Its goal is to eliminate all traffic deaths in the city by 2025, through enforcement, education and street engineering. But what does that mean in practice? How might we realistically redesign our city so that it is more safe for bicycles and pedestrians?',

        text: 'The Fatal 15 is the name given to 15 intersections in the San Diego area that have the highest number of pedestrian deaths and injuries since 2001. Is it possible that these intersections, like Mission Blvd. and Garnet Ave., have something in common that is causing this lack of safety? Circulate San Diego, a local non-profit devoted to promoting safe neighborhoods, streets and intersections compiled the list and estimates the cost to address these dangers at approximately $200,000. Addressing these dangerous spots is important, as is understanding how a spot becomes dangerous over time. What are the early warning signs that an intersection might be deadly, before someone is actually killed in a traffic accident? The Fatal 15 aren’t the only intersections in San Diego though, there are many intersections that are safe and provide a great experience for bikers riding through. What is the difference between these safe intersections and the dangerous ones? What kinds of intersections provide more safety for pedestrians and bikers (e.g. roundabouts and t-junctions)? It’s also imperative that we educate the public about these intersections, and pedestrian safety in general. Education is an effective tool that can be used to give pedestrians alternate routes or even alternate forms of transportation. However, providing education requires some amount of time (rather asking a person to read a pamphlet or listen to a public service announcement), and may not be applied at the appropriate time to encourage someone to alter their behaviors. How might we share information about Circulate San Diego’s research on the Fatal 15 with pedestrians, bikers and drivers as they cruise through these spaces?',

Approximately 17% of San Diegans have some form of impairment that affects their mobility. Individuals older than 60 represent the fastest growing segment of the population, with the number of senior residents expected to double by 2030.

San Diego’s Metropolitan Transit System has outfitted all stations with raised letters and braille plates identifying the route and direction (North/South/East/West), but challenges remain. For example, even the step onto a train can be intimidating. How do people with sensory impairments overcome these everyday barriers? How can the signage at our metro stations be improved? For individuals who are deaf or hearing impaired, the challenge may be a lack of auditory cues. For example, a deaf individual might not hear a big truck bearing down or loud sirens from an ambulance. However, people with partial hearing may have difficulty crowded or loud environments, where the background noise can drown out important messages. How might we improve safety when auditory clues are not available?',

How might we improve access to our city for people with mobility impairments? Though before reinventing the wheel for this Mobility Challenge, it is important to note that there are several existing services in San Diego available to people with mobility impairments.

There must be some way to reduce the effects of this stress (e.g. higher blood pressure, higher weight, and lower fitness levels). Although leaving traffic isn’t any relaxing. Parking can also be a problem, making the entire commute an ordeal. Often, drivers don’t even know where to park because of the small print and confusing rules on parking signage. Many avoid driving themselves altogether and instead commute by public transit. However, the public transit system could use several improvements. Feedback and communication with riders is an interesting one:  Information transfer and communication is an important part of the commuter experience, without feedback and communication it can be difficult to improve the experience, a problem that is faced by the public transit system.',

As the population increases each year more cars join the road and better systems are needed to manage and plan for new parking infrastructure. How might we help drivers and planners navigate the challenge of parking in San Diego? The city of San Diego is broken down into six community parking districts: Downtown, La Jolla, Midtown, Old Town, Pacific Beach, and Uptown, and further into residential and business parking. The challenge at hand is to figure out the most efficient parking plan possible for the areas where parking is deemed “bad”. Drivers need information about where to find a spot and how much time they have left on the meter. The city currently operates with a basic website that only offers static parking information, while a real-time solution might be considered more ideal. “How do we get information to the public?” is a question continually asked by city officials. “It’s not a shortage of parking. It’s a matter of having the parking where people want to go, and having the parking work correctly.” says Gary Smith from San Diego’s Downtown Parking Management Group.',

By definition, traffic congestion is a function of too many cars trying to occupy the same restricted space at the same time. The stop and start to traffic can be maddening. The frustration to being in traffic can easily morph into stress, which has recently come to be referred to as the "car effect." The challenge remains on whether to invest in improving driving experience, such as better roads and education in merging techniques etc., or whether to invest in promoting other means of transportation.

How might we prepare for this major advance in transportation? An important concern about adding Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is the effect of “driverless” on the industries that hire drivers, as well as the drivers themselves. There are also policy questions about Autonomous Vehicles such as, determining fault in the case of an accident (e.g., passenger, manufacturer, designer). However, a related concern is how other drivers will engage with AVs—there is some concern that other drivers might cut off, chase down, or otherwise aggressively engage with AVs. Lastly, it may be easy to hack an AV, as they are designed to continuously receive information from other cars and sensors on the road through a “WiFi like” transmission system. Preparing for AVs may also mean rethinking the design of our existing roadways and signage. If AVs can monitor the speed and distance of other AVs, that means that cars can potentially travel at far faster speeds and in very close proximity.

As one example of how AVs might offer a radically new experience, think about what work might be like while riding in an AV. Many cars are already WiFi-enabled and wired for conference calls.

Though it’s important to note that AVs not only ride on the streets, they might also talk with the street, the light signals and all other sensors even miles down the road. AVs use onboard sensors to detect potential immediate hazards, but also integrate with other cars and sensors in a communication network that connects them to potential dangers miles ahead.For passengers, these safety precautions add to a relaxing experience of being chauffeured, but for walkers, bikers and others’ on the road, negotiating traffic with an AV may be a stressful experience. How might an AV signal to a walker or biker that they have been “seen” and accounted for in the navigation routing system, and that it’s actually safe to walk?other concern is that computing systems can be hacked. To communicate with other cars and sensors along the drive, AVs access part of the radio frequency spectrum set aside explicitly for cars, and called “Dedicated Short-Range Communication.” AVs can use this frequency to communicate with other sensors within a 1,000 foot range. However, because AVs are open to receive signals it leaves them vulnerable to hacking. Hacking a car is somewhat different than breaking in and stealing the vehicle—hacked cars might be rerouted, used to reroute other vehicles, or hacking might simply be to delete the car’s log files.
