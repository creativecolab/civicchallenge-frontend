          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>The 2017 Civic Design Challenge is focused on shaping a San Diego in which
          everybody is able to move freely.</p>
          <p>D4SD has created an opportunity for residents to learn and practice human-centered
          design to solve civic challenges. This year focuses on how to improve mobility in San
          Diego, now and in the future. Mobility is a complex topic, with issues related to
          traffic/parking, accessibility/aging, autonomous vehicles, and public transit.
          Check out the design briefs, pick one or two that interest you, then jump into the
          discussion by signing up. We’re excited to see you there!</p>
          <p>The Design Challenges will officially kick-off in September with an in-person
          design sprint and culminate at the Design Forward Summit on Oct 26-27. At the
          summit, we will announce winners and give out prizes, including cash and support
          for potential startups.</p>

          <h2>Design Process</h2>
          <p>D4SD has developed a series of public activities designed to inspire civic solutions to Mobility challenges in our city.
          It is not necessary to participate in every activity, D4SD is designed so that you can enter and add meaningfully at any point in the process.</p>
          <p>During the <b>Discover</b> phase, you can learn about the design briefs and discuss issues of mobility with fellow
          San Diegans. During the <b>Ideate phase</b>, with a focus on specific problems, you will generate innovative solutions
          and share your ideas with potential teammates.  In the <b>Prototype</b> phase, you can work with teammates to produce a
          rough “mockup” of your best ideas. This can be a physical model, an elaborate sketch, a click-through of a user interface,
          a 3D model, etc. — anything that makes your idea concrete and testable.  In the <b>Implement</b> phase, selected teams will
          have opportunities to partner with City of San Diego to move forward on their civic proposals or with SCALE to explore
          funding options for an early-stage startup.</p>
