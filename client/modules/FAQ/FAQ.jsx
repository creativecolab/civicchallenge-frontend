    question: 'What is unique about the D4SD Civic Design Challenge?',
    answer: 'As an initiative of the <a href="http://designlab.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UC San Diego Design Lab</a>, we have created a process that uses concepts from human-centered design and crowdsourcing to help innovators collectively solve local civic issues.

The goal here is not to just run with your first idea. Come up with lots of ideas, merge them with others, and choose a concept that will be novel, feasible, and impactful.</li><li><b>Prototype:</b> Now that you and your team have an idea, it is time to build a mockup of your concept.  A prototype can be anything that makes your idea concrete and testable, such as a click-through demo, a 3D model, a service-design blueprint, an algorithm, a physical mockup, a video demo, etc. Your goal here is to create a prototype that will help you communicate your vision and test assumptions about your solution. Entries due no later than Oct 22 at 11:59PM PDT. <a href="https://herox.com/D4SD-2017">Register your team</a> by Oct 10.</li><li><b>Implement:</b> Teams with the best prototypes will be selected as finalists and will have unique opportunities to pitch their concept to startup accelerators and the City of San Diego. We would love for your best solutions to make it in the real-world!</li></ol>Furthermore, the D4SD civic design challenge has partnered with <a href="http://www.scalesd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SCALE SD</a> and the <a href="http://designforwardsd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Forward Alliance</a> to host a series of <a href="/events" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in-person events</a> to help you connect with other innovators.
