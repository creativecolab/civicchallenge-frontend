        <h3>What Our Sponsors Do</h3>
        <p>D4SD sponsors are committed to advancing innovation concepts aimed to improve Mobility
        for the millions of residents in the San Diego region. Sponsorship may come in many forms.
        In-kind sponsors can commit access to training and human resources, studio space, or technology.
        Financial sponsorship will help provide incentives for challenge competitions and hackathons planned
        throughout the Mobility challenge. Sponsorship will allow D4SD to offer design teams cash awards
        for the best designs for improving Mobility in our city.</p>
